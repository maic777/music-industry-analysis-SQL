🎵 Music Industry Business Intelligence (SQL)
This project explores a digital music store's database (Chinook) to uncover sales trends, artist popularity, and customer behavior using advanced SQL queries.

📊 Business Questions Addressed
I developed specific queries to solve four key business challenges:

Regional Popularity: Identified the top 4 musical genres in Sydney to understand regional cultural influences on sales.

Top Performers: Analyzed the database to find the top 6 best-selling Rock artists (led by Led Zeppelin).

Content Inventory: Identified which artists have the most extensive discography in the store (led by Iron Maiden).

Engagement Analysis: Determined which playlists have the highest number of tracks to optimize user engagement.

🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
Relational Databases: Navigated complex schemas involving Invoices, Tracks, Albums, and Genres.

Advanced SQL:

Joins: Utilizing INNER JOIN across multiple tables to consolidate data.

Aggregations: Professional use of COUNT(*), GROUP BY, and ORDER BY for data summarization.

Data Filtering: Precise use of WHERE and LIMIT clauses for targeted reporting.

Data Visualization: Translated raw SQL output into clear, easy-to-read charts for stakeholders.

📂 Project Structure
Queries.txt: Contains the raw SQL code for full transparency and reproducibility.

chinook.db: The SQLite database used for the analysis.

Project Report: A visual summary of findings and cultural insights.
